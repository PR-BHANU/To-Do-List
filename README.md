# Project Description
This project is a simple, single-page To-Do App built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Its primary function is to help users manage their daily tasks.

# Key Features:
Task Management: Users can add new tasks by typing them into an input field and clicking the "Add Task" button or by pressing "Enter."

Task Completion: Each task can be marked as complete by clicking the "Complete" button, which visually strikes through the text to indicate it's done.

Task Deletion: Tasks can be permanently removed from the list using the "Delete" button.

User-Friendly Interface: The app has a clean and modern design, using the Inter font family for improved readability. It includes a basic validation to prevent users from adding empty tasks, providing an alert if the input field is empty.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly with a viewport meta tag.

# How It Works:
The JavaScript code handles all the interactive functionality. It listens for clicks on the "Add Task" button and keyboard presses on the input field. When a new task is added, a new list item (<li>) is dynamically created and appended to the task list. Each list item is also given its own "Complete" and "Delete" buttons, with event listeners attached to handle the respective actions.
